# coffee-corner

Takes a list of items and prints a receipt for them.

# Usage:
```bash
./mvnw package # or mvnw.cmd package
`java -cp target/coffee-corner-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.coffee.Main "large coffee with roast coffee, bacon roll, bacon roll and orange juice"`
```
In unlike case of issues with building with maven, there is already a built jar included (coffe-corner.jar).

# Notes
* As suggested, I followed a TDD approach
* Some design decisions are explained in the source code comments
